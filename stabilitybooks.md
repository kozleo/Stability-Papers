## Linear Algebra 

Linear algebra is a must for learning nonlinear dynamical systems theory. That might seem strange--what is the study of *linear* algebra going to tell us about *nonlinear* dynamics? The answer lies in the fact that we have a basically complete theory of linear dynamical systems, and essentially no theory for nonlinear systems. Indeed, the first thing we do when trying to understand a nonlinear system is fractically "linearize" it around some point of interest and then apply linear dynamical systems theory. 

* [Introduction to Dynamical Systems - David Luenberger](https://www.amazon.com/Introduction-Dynamic-Systems-David-Luenberger/dp/0471025941) (specifically chapter 4)
  * If you already know linear algebra, or perhaps just want a refresher, this chapter is very succinct and well-written, with dynamical systems theory in mind. 
* [Introduction to Linear Algebra - Gilbert Strang](https://www.amazon.com/Introduction-Linear-Algebra-Gilbert-Strang/dp/0980232775/ref=sr_1_1?dchild=1&keywords=Linear+Algebra+-+Gilbert+Strang&qid=1599086644&s=books&sr=1-1)
  * Covers linear algebra at the introductory level. The standard textbook basically everybody uses when first learning this stuff.
* [Matrix Analysis - Roger A. Horn & Charles R. Johnson](https://www.amazon.com/Matrix-Analysis-Second-Roger-Horn/dp/0521548233/ref=sr_1_1?dchild=1&keywords=Matrix+Analysis+-+Horn+%26+Johnson&qid=1599086674&s=books&sr=1-1)
  * This is more technical than Strang, but is very, very good. But into context a lot of the 'just-so' results you find in introductory textbooks. The exposition is excellent.

## Calculus / Analysis
I can't recomend a good introductory calculus textbook because I've never met one. Every undergrad calculus class I took was pretty bad. I learned calculus through studying physics and then picked up some real and complex analysis by osmosis. I probably should have taken a formal analysis class or two, but never did. *C'est la vie*.

* [Classical Mechanics - John Taylor](https://www.amazon.com/Classical-Mechanics-John-R-Taylor/dp/B003I03F42/ref=sr_1_1?dchild=1&keywords=Classical+Mechanics+-+John+Taylor&qid=1599086845&s=books&sr=1-1)

## Linear Dynamics & Control
* [Introduction to Dynamical Systems - David Luenberger](https://www.amazon.com/Introduction-Dynamic-Systems-David-Luenberger/dp/0471025941)
  * I used Luenberger when I took MIT 2.151 (Advanced System Dynamics and Control). The writing style is really plain (but not boring) and straightforward. The examples are simple but illuminating. The end of the book covers some nonlinear dynamics as a bonus. 
* [Finite Dimensional Linear Systems - Roger W. Brockett](https://www.amazon.com/Dimensional-Systems-Classics-Applied-Mathematics/dp/1611973872)
  * This book is more technical than Luenberger but I still really liked it. Brockett also writes very clearly. A big difference between this book and Luenberger is that it also covers linear time-varying (LTV) systems, whereas Luenberger only covers linear time-invariant (LTI) systems.
  
## Nonlinear Dynamics & Control

* [Nonlinear Dynamics & Chaos - Steven Strogatz](https://www.amazon.com/Nonlinear-Dynamics-Student-Solutions-Manual/dp/0813349109/ref=sr_1_1?dchild=1&keywords=Nonlinear+Dynamics+%26+Chaos+-+Strogatz&qid=1599086968&s=books&sr=1-1)
  * This is the standard into to nonlinear dynamics and for good reason. Strogatz is an amazing writer.
* [Nonlinear Systems - Hassan Khalil](https://www.amazon.com/Nonlinear-Systems-3rd-Hassan-Khalil/dp/0130673897/ref=sr_1_1?dchild=1&keywords=Nonlinear+Systems+-+Khalil&qid=1599087028&s=books&sr=1-1)
* [Nonlinear Systems Analysis - Mathukumalli Vidyasagar](https://www.amazon.com/Nonlinear-Systems-Analysis-Classics-Mathematics/dp/0898715261)
* [Applied Nonlinear Control - Jean-Jacques Slotine & Weiping Li](https://www.amazon.com/Applied-Nonlinear-Control-Jean-Jacques-Slotine/dp/0130408905/ref=sr_1_1?crid=2ZOZPAPC275O&dchild=1&keywords=applied+nonlinear+control&qid=1599087146&sprefix=applied+nonlinear%2Caps%2C179&sr=8-1)
  * I used this textbook when I took MIT 2.152 (Nonlinear Control System Design). The book is exceptionally clear and contains a lot of wonderful problems. This is where I really learned stability theory.
