## Linear Algebra 

Linear algebra is a must for learning nonlinear dynamical systems theory. That might seem strange--what is the study of *linear* algebra going to tell us about *nonlinear* dynamics? The answer lies in the fact that we have a basically complete theory of linear dynamical systems, and essentially no theory for nonlinear systems. Indeed, the first thing we do when trying to understand a nonlinear system is fractically "linearize" it around some point of interest and then apply linear dynamical systems theory. 

* Introduction to Dynamical Systems - Luenberger (specifically chapter 4)
* Linear Algebra - Gilbert Strang 
* Matrix Analysis - Horn & Johnson

## Calculus / Analysis
I can't recomend a good calculus textbook because I've never encountered one. I learned calculus through studying physics in college and that has proved sufficient. Every calculus class I took was pretty bad. 

* Classical Mechanics - John Taylor
* Introduction to Mathematical Analysis - Rudin

## Linear Dynamics & Control

* Introduction to Dynamical Systems - Luenberger (specifically chapter 4)
* Roger W. Brockett - Finite Dimensional Linear Systems (Decision & Control) (1970)

## Nonlinear Dynamics & Control

* Nonlinear Dynamics & Chaos - Strogatz
* Nonlinear Systems - Khalil
* Nonlinear Systems - Vidyasagar (specifically chapter ___)
* Applied Nonlinear Control - Slotine & Li 

## Non-Technical  

* The Selfish Gene - Dawkins 
  * As Dawkin's points out in the early pages of the book, evolution is about survival of the stable. 

* The Science of the Artificial - Simon

* Cybernetics - Nobert Weiner (specifically chapter _)

* How to Build a Brain - Robert Ashby (specifically chapter ___)

* Sync - Strogatz
