## Linear Algebra 

Linear algebra is a must for learning nonlinear dynamical systems theory. That might seem strange--what is the study of *linear* algebra going to tell us about *nonlinear* dynamics? The answer lies in the fact that we have a basically complete theory of linear dynamical systems, and essentially no theory for nonlinear systems. Indeed, the first thing we do when trying to understand a nonlinear system is fractically "linearize" it around some point of interest and then apply linear dynamical systems theory.

## Calculus / Analysis
I can't recomend a good calculus textbook because I've never encountered one. I learned calculus through studying physics in college and that has proved sufficient. Every calculus class I took was pretty bad. I probably should have taken a formal analysis class or two, but never did. *C'est la vie*.
