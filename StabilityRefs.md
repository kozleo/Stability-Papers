# Books

## Linear Algebra 

Linear algebra is a must for learning dynamical systems theory.

* Introduction to Dynamical Systems - Luenberger (specifically chapter 4)
* Linear Algebra - Gilbert Strang 
* Matrix Analysis - Horn & Johnson

## Calculus / Analysis
I can't recomend a good calculus book because I've never encountered one. I learned calculus through studying physics in college. Every calculus class I took was pretty bad. 

* Classical Mechanics - John Taylor
* Introduction to Mathematical Analysis - Rudin

## Linear Dynamics & Control

* Introduction to Dynamical Systems - Luenberger (specifically chapter 4)
* Roger W. Brockett - Finite Dimensional Linear Systems (Decision & Control) (1970)

## Nonlinear Dynamics & Control

* Nonlinear Dynamics & Chaos - Strogatz
* Nonlinear Systems - Khalil
* Nonlinear Systems - Vidyasagar (specifically chapter ___)
* Applied Nonlinear Control - Slotine & Li 

## Non-Technical  

* The Selfish Gene - Dawkins 
  * As Dawkin's points out in the early pages of the book, evolution is about survival of the stable. 

* The Science of the Artificial - Simon

* Cybernetics - Nobert Weiner (specifically chapter _)

* How to Build a Brain - Robert Ashby (specifically chapter ___)
